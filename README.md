## Overview


The goal of this project is to find the best suitable ML model to predict the price of diamonds using a Kaggle dataset [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diamonds-datamad0620).

First, we clean the dataset in order to understand how data is distributed and what variables could weigh in in the prediction.

Then, we test different regression ML algorithms to see which one shows a higher R2 and RMSE.

Finally, we choose the two models with the highest score and we perform a hyperparameter optimization with GridSearchCV to increase the accuracy of the prediction.
