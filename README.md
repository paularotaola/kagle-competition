## Overview


The goal of this project is to find the best suitable ML model to predict the price of diamonds using a Kaggle dataset [https://www.kaggle.com/c/diamonds-datamad0620].

First, we clean the dataset understanding how data is distributed and what variables could weigh in in the prediction.

Then, through trial and error we test different ML algorithms to see which ones accomodate better to the test data and upload it to Kaggle to evaluate the performance of the model.
